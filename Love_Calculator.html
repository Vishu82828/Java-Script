    <p>Welcome to this great invention of Doctor Love! <br> <br><br>
    
    We all know that a name can tell a lot about a person. Names are not randomly chosen: they all have a meaning. Doctor
    Love knew this so he made another great invention just for the lonely you! <br><br><br>

    two people. The Love Calculator is an affective way to get an impression of what the chances are on a relationship
    between two people. <br><br><br>
